# PracticeMakesPermanent
A list of links you and I can use to get better at cybering and coding

## Online and Persistent Capture the Flags:
- [Hack this Site!](https://www.hackthissite.org/) - An oldie but a goody to learn the basics of many forms of web application hacking
- [Over the Wire](https://overthewire.org/wargames/) - Exercises about using PowerShell to accomplish infosec tasks
- [PicoCTF](https://picoctf.com/) - One of the go-to CTF sites. Can do it all year or their yearly competition. 
- [Hacker101](https://ctf.hacker101.com/) - Run by HackerOne, a popular bug bounty/security company
- [Hack the Box](https://www.hackthebox.eu/) - HTB is another of the go-to sites to practice. Write-ups of labs are frequently available online
- [VulnHub](https://www.vulnhub.com/) - Mostly boot2root VMs that you download, pop, get flags, and move on. Common to see people pop these and write them up for practice/learning

## Online and Persistent CTFs, but for Coding:

## Featuring (or at least has a category for) Forensics, Defense, or SOC:
